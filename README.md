/*
 * This is a simple Java example demonstrating OOP concepts:
 * - Inheritance (Monitor, Motherboard, ComputerCase, PersonalComputer extend Product)
 * - Composition (PersonalComputer has Monitor, Motherboard, and ComputerCase)
 * - Encapsulation (fields are private and accessed via constructors/methods)
 *
 * Realistic computer components are used to make the example more practical.
